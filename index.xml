      <description>Machine learning/Astronomy PhD student with Dr Anna Scaife @ University of Manchester. University of Oxford MPhys graduate.
My PhD work involves building robust machine learning systems process the vast deluge of data (exabyte scale) we are about to receive from next-generation telescopes. Since this much data cannot be curated by humans, we need AI that can deal with messy, real-world data with few labels and many possible anomalies.
My research has included semi-supervised learning and use of unlabelled data for improved classification in the astronomy domain, bespoke contrastive learning applied to astronomical data-sets and use of generative algorithms to simulate astronomical objects.</description>
