<p>I am working on building robust machine learning systems to process the vast deluge of data (exabyte scale) we are about to receive from next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array.</p>
<p>Since this much data cannot be curated by humans, we need AI that can deal with messy, real-world data with few labels, unknown data sub-manifolds and out-of-distribution data.</p>
<p>My research has included semi-supervised learning and use of unlabelled data for improved classification in the astronomy domain, developing bespoke contrastive learning methods to apply to astronomical data-sets and use of generative algorithms to simulate astronomical objects.</p>
<p>I enjoy sharing my work with both computer scientists and astronomers and have published my work/given talks at NeurIPS, ICML, EAS and more. A comprehensive list of my publications can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P3unBhsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
<h1 id="broader-interests">Broader Interests</h1>
<p>I believe that a diverse range of perspectives is key to making breakthroughs and precipitating key insights into difficult technical problems. AI is no exception to this, and as we&rsquo;ve seen with groundbreaking work such as <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold">Alpha Fold</a>, computer scientists have much to learn from scientists and domain experts and vice versa.</p>
<p>I think that we can learn from this success by nurturing further collaboration between the academic machine learning community and those wanting to use AI to solve a domain-specific problem. I always enjoy hearing from people with other perspectives and am open to collaborating on AI based projects.</p>
